        This is only an EXCERPT from the official text as I am not legally allowed to provide the entire codex for you.
        If you are interested in getting a real LEGAL COPY then please do your own research because quite frankly I have
        been through hell trying to get my own legit issue and feel like someone else needs to experience my agony. Have fun.

        ...And that's pretty much how it all happened. Yep! I was standing still, board in hand, a mere 13 feet away from the Kickflip
				Pit of a genuine Golvensteed Matriarch. Not some petty longboarding extendo-beast your regular issue skatemags refer to.
				No. This was a prime specimen! A real feast for the eyes of a wizard such as myself!
        <br>
        It was in this very moment that I knew I'd be later writing about this in my very own textbook, that is, if I made it out alive! Ha!
        <br>
        Regardless, I was deep in tactical thought, planning out my next trick as I neared the quarter pipe while narrowly avoiding the beast's talons.
				Rather terrifying, I must say! I had to get my hands on...

        For real I'm not gonna leak anymore of Galifax's book because I am absolutely NOT getting on that guy's bad side.
        Thats like one of the best segments in the book though. Seriously if that didn't sell you then maybe you should just quit Wizardry all together. I'm not here to play
        some cute little roleplaying game with all you idiots that think that you can do magic like Galifax just because you watched a movie like
        Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. Go ahead and buy the book and hang out on my <a href="power_index.html">webspace</a> and get a real education.
