An interesting (hopefully) HTML thing

(open power_index.html to access the "home page")

I called my friend a "skateboarding wizard" while talking via the net. After that, I just kind of let that become the base idea for my HTML thingy.

[Also worth noting] I wrote a lot of this without committing/pushing to github as I was having just a bit of trouble figuring out how to make that work. I figured it out though and now we're all set!
